# MOInApp 
=====================
## Change Log:

### Version 1.0.0  *(21st February, 2020)*
-------------------------------------------
* Main SDK Rearchitected and has been split into 5 modules now i.e, `MoEngageCore`, `MOAnalytics`, `MOMessaging`, `MOInApp` and `MoEngage`(Umbrella framework).
* InApp Module completely revamped, and has to be integrated separately now. Most of the APIs have changed, therefore refer to this [doc](https://docs.moengage.com/docs/in-app-nativ) to reintegrate the module to the project.
